#A call in the universal spirit of Christ Jesus to all the wicked and impenitent sinners in the world, but more especially to the inhabitants of England, with the city of London, that they all may repent and turn to God, with all their hearts, before his wrath be more kindled, and his future judgements more appear to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their manifold horrible sins and transgressions : this came upon me to write, at the apprehension I had of that sudden fear which many people were suprised with, at the late earthquake, of what would befall them / [by] J.P.#
